# this course

I took this course in order to learn more about DevOps theory and practices. I'll work in the software industry during my future career, so I think understanding DevOps is very important for me. I already have some working experience as a software developer. Our agile team has been using DevOps for a while, but I haven't been involving in developing DevOps related tools or e.g. CI/CD scripts or pipelines by myself. So I understand the basic principles of DevOps, but I should learn more about how to utilize DevOps in practice.

I'm also expecting to learn why DevOps is important and why one should exercise DevOps practices at all. I'd also like to learn about continuous integration, continuous delivery, continuous deployment and what is actually the different of those terms that I hear very often. I'm looking forward to see some interesting videos about the topic and possibly do some practical exercises as well. I think DevOps is a topic which can't be learned only by reading a book, but doing some practical stuff and getting my hands dirty is more useful. Of course basic theoretical understanding about DevOps should be gained before starting to implement e.g. CI/CD pipelines or related scripts.

Another reason for taking this course is that I also took course 'Cloud Systems and Technologies' and I think it's useful to take these two courses together. In fact, the courses are a part of larger course called 'Mobile Cloud Computing'. That course would have been interesting, but I did not have time to take the whole course during this semester, since my schedule is very busy.

# learned

My learning during this course took place mostly through tutorial videos which I found very interesting and useful. I watched all of those tutorials and learned many new concepts related to DevOps, CI and CD. I learned that DevOps is not only about specific tools and technologies. It's more about organizational culture and practices.

The ultimate goal of DevOps is to be able to build, test and release software in a convenient and highly automated way, such that only little human efforts are needed during the process. According to DevOps practices, the organization does not have separate development and operations team as in the case of traditional software development methods. Instead, development, operations and possibly quality and security teams are merged into one team such that everybody in the team can do actual coding and so called administration tasks (the former should be highly automated).

DevOps is typically used together with continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD). This enables that the new code is always build and tested immediately after push and can be deployed to the production at any time. Possible code errors or other issues are detected at early phase and can be fixed immediately without causing problems to the customer. Deploying new features to production is very convenient and should not require any extra efforts. Continuous deployment means that the recently integrated code is automatically deployed to production.

DevOps is used in order to be able to respond rapid environment and business requirement changes. For example, if the customer wants a new feature as soon as possible, is can easily be implemented and delivered quickly if agile methods, DevOps and CI/CD is used.

I found this course quite easy and effortless, given that I have a strong background in computer science. I think writing this diary was the most time-consuming part during the course. However this course gives only one credit, so the workload should not be very high.
