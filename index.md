# About me

I'm a 5th year student at Aalto University, majoring in control, robotics and autonomous systems. I'm especially interested in control engineering, robotics, machine learning and software development in general. I also work part-time as a software developer alongside my studies. I have a decent amount of programming experience from different projects both from school and work, including simple games, web applications with modern web technologies and machine learning and data analysis solutions. I'm planning to complete my last compulsory and optional courses during the next spring and start to write a master's thesis either in summer or in autumn. I'd like to work with interesting and challenging tasks and develop some high-tech solutions after graduation.
